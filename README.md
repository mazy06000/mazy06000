# Welcome! 👋

Hello! I'm **M. Mazy**, an AI Engineer with over 4 years of experience in software development and data science. I am passionate about leveraging technology to address complex challenges in various domains, including healthcare 🏥, environmental sustainability 🌍, and Islamic research 📚.

I am actively working on:

- **AI-Powered SaaS for Islamic Learning**: Developing a platform that utilizes artificial intelligence to revolutionize Islamic education, making learning more accessible and engaging.

- **Ethical AI Matrimonial Platform**: Facilitating halal matchmaking by preventing unnecessary mixity and private interactions that could lead to unhealthy conversations, ensuring a faith-based and respectful approach.
